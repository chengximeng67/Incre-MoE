# Incremental Mixture of Experts: Continual Learning for Object Detection in Forestry Scenarios

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation and experimental configurations for our paper, **"Incremental Mixture of Experts: Continual Learning for Object Detection in Forestry Scenarios"**, submitted to the journal *Pattern Recognition*.

Our work introduces **Incre-MoE**, a novel framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for object detection, particularly in challenging, real-world scenarios that involve both domain and class increments.

## What's Included?

This repository provides all the necessary components to reproduce the findings presented in our paper:

*   The full source code for the **Incre-MoE** framework.
*   Detailed, step-by-step instructions for dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.
*   A `requirements.txt` file for setting up the exact software environment.
*   Configuration files and hyperparameter settings used in our experiments.
*   Scripts and raw data to reproduce key figures, such as the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.

We welcome any questions or feedback. Please open an issue if you encounter any problems.
